Temporal Expression Identification to Go (TEI2GO) is an approach for fast and effective identification of temporal
expressions.
Currently, TEI2GO has models for **six** languages:

- German
- English
- Spanish
- Italian
- French
- Portuguese

However, it can be expanded to other languages. If you intend to expand it to another language feel free to create an issue, fork the repo, and do a pull request.  

## ðŸ¤— HuggingFace Hub

To facilitate the usage, all TEI2GO models were published on [HuggingFace Hub](https://huggingface.co/hugosousa). The code below demonstrates how one can load the French model:

On the command line, run:

```bash
pip install https://huggingface.co/hugosousa/fr_tei2go/resolve/main/fr_tei2go-any-py3-none-any.whl
```

Then the model can be loaded in two ways:

1. Using Spacy

```python
import spacy
nlp = spacy.load("fr_tei2go")
```

2. Importing as a module

``` python
import fr_tei2go
nlp = fr_tei2go.load()
```

## Development environment

```shell
virtualenv venv --python=python3.8
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To assert that everything is working run pytest: `python -m pytest tests`

## Train

```shell
python -m src.run spacy  --data tempeval_3 ph_english --language en
```

### Download Pre-Trained Models

```shell
cd models
sh download.sh
```

### Download Resources

```shell
cd resources
sh download.sh
